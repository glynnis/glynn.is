          Naveon's mobile app helps patients, patients' families, and their Care
          Teams get to know each other, engage in important (and sometimes
          difficult) conversations, and stay connected even after discharge. The
          mobile app is powered by a web application where Care Teams can manage
          their patients' Plans of Care, define diagnoses, collaborate with
          other medical staff, and customize content patients see.

        <blockquote>
          Glynnis is a ‘full stack designer.’ She’s led initial user experience and
          requirements gathering efforts, translated those requirements into visual
          designs and mockups, and built the final HTML and CSS to implement the vision.

        <blockquote>
          Glynnis is one of the most valuable, most effective people I’ve had
          the opportunity to work with. As a UI/UX specialist, Glynnis
          continually demonstrates an ability to help clients uncover the
          nuances of their requirements while being a strong advocate for the
          end user. Her design decisions always appear thoughtfully considered
          across the spectrum of aesthetics, usability, accessibility, and
          brand/message consistency.

          When the team would find itself lost in the weeds on an issue, Glynnis always
          knew how to pull us back, reorient ourselves, and refocus on how a problem
          actually affects our users.
