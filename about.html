  <h1 class="page-title">Hi, I'm Glynnis.</h1>

  <div class="about-body">
    <p>
      I’m a multidisciplinary freelance designer with <b>10+ years of experience in
      everything from traditional graphic design, UI/UX design, and design for web
      and mobile apps.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      I love digging deep to understand complex problems and user behavior. I
      focus on creating modern, user-centered designs that are accessible,
      inclusive, and distinctive.
    </p>

    <p>
      My career in tech began with software development, and <b>I feel at home
      working with engineers</b> to understand technical limitations and find solutions
      that can be <b>implemented iteratively without compromising creative vision or
      user experience.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      I've managed design teams at small companies, worked with start-ups and
      non-profits, and led work on design systems at a large enterprise company.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I’m not designing, you can find me at the clay studio throwing or
      handbuilding ceramics inspired by the colors and tropical flora of New Orleans.

      Glynnis is an excellent communicator who also consistently helped facilitate planning the direction of our projects. Her ability to see the big picture for the company and maintain a detail-oriented view in her role made the projects Glynnis was on successful. Glynnis is able to interweave between the development and design skill sets such that she can excel at both roles.
