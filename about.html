  <h1 class="page-title">Hi, I'm Glynnis.</h1>

  <div class="about-body">
    <p>
      I’m a UX Designer at Boundless, an open source platform for location-based data.
      Previously, I led design on the EncoreUI Framework, a design system and component
      library for internal tools at Rackspace.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m passionate about creative collaboration, interdisciplinary teams, and the
      spaces where elegant code and delightful experiences overlap.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I’m not designing for the web, I design books and print collateral for Big
      Class, a New Orleans nonprofit that cultivates and supports voices of writers aged
      6 to 18. People also know me know me as a calligrapher, tea connoisseur, and
      tabletop gaming nerd.
