		<h3 class="sub-header">Empower users to tell stories</h3>
		<p>
			MapStory is a free, open source, editable atlas of world history where
			storytellers can showcase a nuanced understanding of historical change. With
			MapStory’s Composer, storytellers can quickly and easily combine spatiotemporal
			data with narrative elements like images, text, and video. Embeddable MapStories
			help viewers better understand how our world has evolved geographically over
			time. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Unlike its competitors, MapStory provides users a platform for telling stories
			with maps that change over time. Many GIS tools require expensive, complex,
			multi-platform services to create maps without any means of representing time—a
			confusing work flow for users that makes telling meaningful stories with
			geospatial data challenging. MapStory’s web-based, open source approach provides
			a single, free platform for creating maps, and lets users embed their work
			anywhere they choose.
		</p>

		<p>
			At the center of MapStory’s offering is Composer, a web tool for creating
			MapStories—embeddable, video-like presentations of geospatial data. Despite its
			adoption by the press, disease control centers, historians, and others, MapStory
			struggled to present an intuitive Composer workflow to users.

    <p>
			As the sole designer on the project, I wore many hats: researcher, UX designer,
			visual designer, front-end designer, and user acceptance tester.
    </p>

    <p>
			I employed a user-centered design approach to eliminate pain points across the
			site. With an initial focus on redesigning Composer from the ground up, I also
			explored its entry and exit points to identify key areas to target for future
			work. 
    </p>

    <p>
			Meanwhile, the development team was also working on new Composer features and
			iterations with development and refactoring slated for the first quarter of
			2017. I simultaneously redesigned the existing Composer and designed the new
			features in the pipeline while working with product management and engineering
			to begin design implementation.

		<h2 class="section-title">The Approach</h2>
		<h3 class="sub-header">Explore with fresh eyes</h3>
    <p>
			Prior to my involvement, MapStory suffered from lack of consistent funding which
			resulted in piecemeal development, a revolving door of team members, perpetually
			shifting priorities, and a reactive development process that lacked long-term
			vision. In its two year history, MapStory had never had a consistent design
			presence or focus on user experience. 
    </p>

		<div class="pull-quote-wide">
			<blockquote>
				In its two year history, MapStory had never benefited from a consistent design
				presence or focus on user experience.
			</blockquote>
		</div>

    <p>
			Interface design fell to developers by default, and in the rush to get features
			out the door, the introduction of external libraries became commonplace.
			Band-aids were applied to band-aids. Features were parachuted in and then
			forgotten. The result: a patchwork UI with features hiding in nooks and crannies
			and no discernible task flow. After MapStory gained more funding, making up for
			lost design time became crucial.
    </p>

    <p>
			As the newest member of the project and someone without a background in GIS, I
			needed to get up to speed quickly, demonstrate my value, and provide direction
			to the team. I got to work exploring the site and I used my fresh perspective to
			my advantage.
    </p>

    <p>
			Who are the users of MapStory, and how do their needs differ? How could I reduce
			the time required to compose a story by simplifying and redesigning the
			interface? In what ways could I allow users to focus on their content, rather
			than the composing process? 
    </p>

		<div class="pull-quote-wide">
			<blockquote>
				In what ways could I allow users to focus on their content rather than the

			</blockquote>
		</div>

    <p>
			Could I easily navigate the site, understand the tools provided, and create a
			MapStory?  How could Composer provide flexibility, make workflows easy to
			understand, and empower users to produce MapStories with rich narratives?
    </p>

  </div>

<section>
  <div class="case-study">
		<h2 class="section-title">Discovery</h2>
		<h3 class="sub-header">Sort your supplies before you build</h3>
    <p>
			During my exploration of MapStory and interviews with the team, I outlined my
			understanding of the building blocks Composer provided, the relationships
			between them, and how they assembled to produce a complete, embeddable MapStory
			playable by a viewer, such as someone reading the news online. Once I understood
			the pieces and their conceptual relationships to each other, I was ready to
			begin reorganizing the Composer for a more intuitive presentation to the user.
    </p>

		<h3 class="sub-header">User insights</h3>
    <p>
			I identified key points of friction in the Composer user flow and met with the
			product owner and engineering team to ask questions about intent. We discussed
			and defined the vision for an improved Composer interface and a more robust,
			expanded feature set. 
    </p>

    <p>
			I also interviewed the Content Team, a small group of super users identified by
			the product owner who were working to produce interesting content on the site,
			each with a different interest or specialty.
    </p>

    <p>
			During interviews, many users requested features that already existed but were
			difficult to find, or confessed that they couldn’t understand all the options
			presented.

		<h3 class="sub-header large">Restrictive, Linear Workflow</h3>
		<p>
			Consider videography. It would be absurd to shoot, edit, and produce a film one
			scene at a time from start to finish. Instead, scenes that share a set are shot
			together, even if they don’t appear back to back in a film. Similarly, users
			didn’t come to Composer ready to input all their data in the order it would be
			seen during playback. Instead, they jump around the interface to put in all the
			geospatial data at once, add all their descriptive text and titles at the same
			time, or customize colors and styles applied to each chapter.
		</p>

		<h3 class="sub-header large">Invisible & Puzzling Features</h3>
		<p>
			User didn’t understand what features were present, and struggled to understand
			the significance or value of the ones they could find. They felt frustrated and
			confined by the tool, unsure of how to transform geospatial data into the rich
			narratives they envisioned.

		</p>

		<h3 class="sub-header large">We Aren't in WYSIWYG Anymore</h3>
		<p>
			Depending on the user’s browser width and its aspect ratio, map edges in
			Composer might not match those of the fixed-width embeddable viewer. Users
			couldn’t anticipate the precise area of the map their viewers would see.
		</p>

		<h3 class="sub-header large">Long & Winding Trails of Breadcrumbs</h3>
		<p>
			Users struggled to navigate the components of their MapStory. Jumps from
			high-level structure to gritty detail were impossible since the interface
			required users to navigate deep trees of breadcrumbs progressively, one step at
			a time.

			focus on providing users a tool that’s easy to use, flexible, and accommodates

    <p>
			Redesign of the embeddable viewer is slated for late 2017, so Composer’s
			redesign needs to be flexible enough to accommodate new features that may be
			introduced to enhance the embeddable viewer when the time comes. 
		</p>

    <img src="img/mapstory_sidebar.gif">

    <p>
			A new, tabbed sidebar provides better context for which part of the story is
			being edited and allows the user to jump easily between chapters, making it easy
			to jump from high- to low-level, granular story editing. This also facilitates
			easy copy and paste between sections with shared content or settings. Easier
			navigation puts users in control of their own workflow, and doesn’t impose a
			linear process.
    </p>

    <img src="img/mapstory_legend.png">

    <p>
			New “apply to all” checkboxes throughout the interface reduce the amount of time
			necessary to create a story, and increase the impact of a user’s effort in
			Composer.
    </p>

    <img src="img/mapstory_storypin.png">

    <p>
			Better editing mode indicators, contextual help, and explanatory copy help users
			discover, understand, and take advantage of features when composing a MapStory.
			Different types of users with different goals can easily understand which
			features enhance their composing process. The interface accommodates all user
			personas as elegantly and flexibly as possible.
    </p>

    <img src="img/mapstory_preview.png">

    <p>
			Preview mode helps storytellers quickly understand how their MapStory will
			translate to the embeddable viewer. It’s never been easier for storytellers to
			understand how audiences will see their work in Composer.

<section>
  <div class="case-study">
		<h2 class="section-title">How We Got There</h2>
		<h3 class="sub-header">Design first, followed by iterative progress toward milestones</h3>
    <p>
			MapStory’s investors and stakeholders wanted to see quick demonstrated progress,
			despite a desire not to be involved in the discovery process. Balancing a long
			wish list of features with quick, iterative deliveries of work presented a
			challenge throughout the course of the project. 
    </p>

    <p>
			As the first and only designer on the project, I provided a structure and
			framework for producing and showcasing design work ahead of development, which
			gave the team a clear understanding of what we needed to be built, which in turn
			helped us to hit project benchmarks on time. To align the development team,
			product owner, investors, and stakeholders, I shared user insights, key
			findings, drafts of the design, and progress reports along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
			Once I secured buy-in across the board for a user-centered design approach, I
			worked closely with the product owner and engineering teams to facilitate
			discussion and concretely define milestones so we’d have checkpoints and
			iterative progress toward the overall vision to share with investors and
			stakeholders along the way.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-header">Inspiration</h3>

    <p>
			Few competitors in web-based mapping tools have features that need to be
			accommodated in a user-friendly interface such as MapStory does. Though
			competitors do present interesting interfaces to consider for styling and
			editing geospatial data, none help users produce a playable map that displays
			change over time. I needed to find interesting user experiences—both successful
			and unsuccessful—to draw inspiration for MapStory’s Composer redesign.
    </p>

    <p>
			I turned to video production and editing software, online video communities,
			sound engineering software, and other applications with a temporal focus,
			especially ones that provided granular control and non-linear workflows.
    </p>

    <img src="img/mapstory_inspiration.png">

    <h3 class="sub-header">Prototyping</h3>
    <p>
			To ensure the organization and workflow provided by the new interface made
			sense, I produced low-fidelity wireframes to discuss in detail with the
			development team and product owner.
    </p>

    <img src="img/mapstory_wireframe.png" style="width:24em;">

    <p>
			Facilitating these discussions helped me uncover the hidden features of Composer
			that were difficult to discover by clicking through the interface. By outlining
			the current feature set with developers and identifying feature sets where they
			lacked experience or understanding of intent, I created a shared understanding
			on the team of our blind spots and areas of Composer that were especially hard
			to understand or use. Throughout Composer we discovered features that didn’t
			function the way the team thought they did, or didn’t match the product owner’s
			intent—often the unintended result of half-finished features due to rotating
			team members or sudden lack of funding.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-header">High-fidelity Mock-ups & Styleguide</h3>
    <p>
			After revisions and additional review, the team felt satisfied with the
			interface and feature set the wireframes communicated. From there, I created
			high-fidelity versions of the wireframes to explore color, typefaces, and things
			like hover, active, and error states for interactive elements.
    </p>

    <p>
			I created clickable prototypes and scheduled informal group review sessions with
			the Content Team—our group of super users—and walked them through my vision for
			the redesign. I focused discussion on areas of the design where:
      <ul>
				<li>
					I had made assumptions about what users would prefer.
        </li>
				<li>
					The team had questions about whether an easier or existing solution would suffice.
        </li>
				<li>
					We thought we might not meet users’ expectations, or further explanation and contextual help was needed.
        </li>
				<li>
					Where we wanted to validate that the design met the needs of all the personas we defined.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
			The Content Team also helped guide the team where we felt unqualified to make a
			decision without user input—things like choosing sensible default settings, or
			where “apply to all” checkboxes would be useful.
    </p>

    <p>
			While working on the high-fidelity prototypes, I also built and maintained a
			style guide that would serve as a skeleton for writing CSS. The style guide also
			helped in discussions with developers about which elements of Composer would be
			useful to abstract into reusable Angular components to minimize development
			effort once underway.
    </p>

    <img src="img/mapstory_styleguide.png">

		<h3 class="sub-header">Final Design</h3>
    <p>
			With high-fidelity mock-ups and clickable prototypes validated with users, I led
			final discussions with the development team and product owner to zero in on
			areas of the design that would require a high level of effort. To maintain
			budget and timelines, we created simpler yet elegant alternatives to more
			ambitious features that could be iterated on in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
			We created milestones and granular development stories to represent the scope of
			the first release, the order in which the work must be done, and iterations and
			touch points along the way. Once defined, I made final revisions to the designs
			to represent precisely what the team had committed to so that features depicted
			in mock-ups didn’t show future iterations or implementations not detailed by the
			stories we had written.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="case-study">
		<h2 class="section-title">Results</h2>
    <p>
			Now, the development team has the most complete set of design mock-ups they have
			ever worked with, and I’m working closely with front-end developers to implement
			CSS and bring my designs to life in the browser and ensure that designs are
			implemented with high attention to detail.
    </p>

    <p>
			Once the redesign is released, I will write an interview script and conduct user
			acceptance testing. With feedback and responses to some of the same questions I
			asked during discovery, I’ll be able to provide quantitative and qualitative
			metrics to stakeholders and the team (load time, amount of time needed to
			compose the same MapStory, how confident users feel about what viewers will see
			based on a change they made, etc.). This will help us evaluate the redesign’s
			success in solving key problems for users, and determine which areas require
			more work and creative solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
			As the project progresses and the work goes live, I’ll be updating this case
			study to reflect lessons learned and successes or failures along the way.
