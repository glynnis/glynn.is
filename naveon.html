      creates a personalized experience for patients receiving post-acute care.
      We focused on helping patients, patients' families, and their Care Teams
      get to know each other, engage in important (and sometimes difficult)
      conversations, and stay connected even after discharge.  In addition, we
      designed a web application where Care Teams can manage their patients'
      Plans of Care, define diagnoses, collaborate with other medical staff, and
      customize content viewable in the mobile app by facility.

    <h2 class="section-title">The Challenge</h2>
    <h3 class="sub-header">
      Help patients, families, and Care Teams form strong, personal connections
    </h3>
    <p>
      The post-acute care environment can be a challenging one to navigate for
      patients, families, and Care Teams.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Care Teams, communicating conditions clearly and recommending
      treatments is already difficult, and in palliative care—where the goal is
      to comfort the patient rather than provide curative or preventative
      treatment—this is even more challenging.
    </p>

    <p>
      For patients and families, understanding the significance of a decision
      can be murky. They often lack the context to see ripple effects or they
      feel lost in medical jargon. For loved ones making decisions on an
      incapacitated patient’s behalf, it can be a struggle to weigh the
      patient’s desires against their own.
    </p>

    <p>
      Naveon, a leading healthcare technology company, wanted to incorporate lessons
      learned from their intensive care unit apps and brainstorm new ways of
      enhancing doctor/patient communication.
    </p>

    <p>
      They understood the medical, emotional, and spiritual crises that can
      occur when someone is seriously ill, and that the best decisions are made
      when patients, families, and Care Teams forge meaningful, personal
      connections to each other. Research shows that improved communication
      leads to a reduction in unwanted care and higher satisfaction for patients
      and their Care Teams.
    </p>

    <p>
      They needed an app to:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Accelerate the process of Care Teams getting to know their patients’
          personalities, core values, beliefs, and care preferences
        </li>

        <li>
          Facilitate difficult conversations between patients and their families
        </li>

        <li>
          Help families and loved ones make decisions even if a patient is incapacitated
        </li>

        <li>
          Keep patients connected to their Care Teams even after discharge (and
          prevent unnecessary visits to the emergency room)
        </li>

        <li>
          Customize content for a patient’s diagnosis, care facility, and health situation
        </li>

        <li>
          Assist Care Teams efficiently manage a wide range of patients
        </li>

    <h2 class="section-title">My Role</h2>
    <h3 class="sub-header">
      Simplify complex cross-platform systems to create an engaging, personal experience
    </h3>
    <p>
      As the sole designer on such a large cross-platform project, I led the design
      process from start to finish on NewAperio’s small, highly-collaborative,
      cross-disciplinary team and worked directly with their customer, Naveon.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before engaging us, Naveon had already launched a similar mobile and web
      application to manage content for patients in intensive care units. Naveon
      wanted to incorporate lessons learned in the ICU and brainstorm new ways
      of enhancing doctor/patient communication in the new post-acute context.
    </p>

    <p>
      Though Naveon’s team had already developed content and knew the key to
      success laid in building close connections between Care Teams and their
      patients, they weren’t entirely sure where to make changes or how to
      improve their current model.
    </p>

    <p>
      My work with the Naveon team revealed that while the content they created
      supported and educated patients, it fell short in creating a system Care
      Teams could use to “treat the whole person.” We needed to design an
      engaging experience and prompt patients, families, and Care Teams to
      consider how a patient’s values, beliefs, and preferences can inform
      decision making about healthcare.

    <h3 class="sub-header large">Product Design Sprint</h3>
    <p>
      With NewAperio’s Founder & CEO, I led a Product Design Sprint—a five-phase
      process (modeled after
      <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/">the process defined by Google Ventures</a>)
      that uses design thinking to brainstorm and prototype innovative solutions
      and test them with real customers.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-header large">Planning & Scope Definition</h3>
    <p>
      I partnered with my client (<a href="http://www.newaperio.com">NewAperio</a>)
      and their customer (<a href="http://www.naveonguides.com">Naveon</a>) to uncover
      assumptions, identify complexities, gather and clarify requirements, and write user
      stories. I worked closely with developers to vet technical feasibility and
      create a shared understanding of the problems we needed to solve.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="column-2">
    <h3 class="sub-header large">Strategy & Vision</h3>
    <p>
      Through an heuristic evaluation I developed the concept of “Get To Know
      Me”, which became the central feature of the application. I devised an
      information architecture for the complex administrative back end used by
      Care Teams to manage content, as well as the intuitive user-facing mobile
      application.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-header large">Illustration & Visual Design</h3>
    <p>
      I shifted Naveon’s color palette to increase accessibility while
      maintaining established branding. I created a visual vocabulary and design
      system for use across platforms with visual fluorishes and custom
      illustrations that re-inforce Naveon’s brand messaging around guidance and
      support.

    <h2 class="section-title">The Approach</h2>
    <h3 class="sub-header">Early prototyping and user testing with a product
      design sprint</h3>
    <p>
      Following the framework outlined by
      <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/">
        Google Ventures’ <em>Sprint: Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days</em>
      </a>,
      we mapped the problem, sketched detailed solutions, identified
      our primary goal, created a prototype, then interviewed and tested with users in
      just five days.
    </p>

    <div class="pull-quote-wide">
      <blockquote>
        The design sprint process...was among the best I have encountered in my
        35+ year career. The well-defined structure imposed a
        discipline on the process that amplified both the productivity and
        creativity, where frequently the focus on one occurs at the expense of
        the other. The testing of our design output that followed yielded real
        insight and we walked away from the process with solid concepts and a
        framework for moving forward. It also made it even clearer that this was
        a team of individuals with whom we wanted to work.
      </blockquote>
      <div class="endorsement-author">–Kevin Lyle, Founder & CTO @ Naveon</div>
    </div>

    <p> </p>

    <p>
      For the design sprint, we focused on creating higher engagement and
      satisfaction for patients and their families (even after discharge), while
      making it easier for Care Teams to deliver high-quality care.
    </p>

    <img src="img/naveon_sketch.jpg">

    <p>
      In early sketches, I conceptualized how we might gather information like
      values, beliefs, hobbies, and other personal characteristics about the
      Patient. The experience should draw the user in with highly interactive
      inputs and flows centered around sharing and exploring. Still, we needed
      to gently guide patients and their loved ones to help them zero in on when
      and how to make deicisions about their care, supported by educational
      resources and a close relationship to their Care Team.
    </p>

    <img src="img/naveon_prototype.jpg">

    <p>
      We included a “nucleus”-like design in our prototype that allowed users to
      define what was important to them, assign it an emoji, and put more
      important things closer to the center of the circle design. In our user
      testing sessions, we found that while the concept of a personal profile as
      a way to connect with Care Teams resonated deeply, the idea and design of
      the “nucleus” interface and assigning emojis wasn’t intuitive enough.

      With valuable feedback gathered from users during the design sprint, we
      kicked off the project knowing that we’d need to pivot and expand our
      approach for onboarding patients with a rich questionaire and profile
      builder in the mobile app.

      Throughout the one-week sprint, we found a natural cadence of splitting to work
      as independent disciplines (design, UI, API dev, etc.) and coming back together
      to make sure we were still in sync. In this way, we quickly made major decisions
      about the structure of the API, the look and feel of the interface, and the
      search algorithm while maintaining unity of vision and shared momentum. Tight
      feedback loops and collaboration across disciplines made Encore Search a strong
      tool from the very beginning.

      Throughout the sprint, the leader and key members of the Phone Team would
      join us for half an hour to answer questions about their workflow, validate
      sketches and design ideas, and verify assumptions the team made about their
      needs. We also referred back to the study completed earlier in the year and the
      findings associated with the Phone Team.

      The vision for Encore Search: to help the Phone Team find accounts, verify
      customers, and transfer calls to the right specialist who could help them with
      whatever they were calling about. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We didn’t want to provide yet another tool in the arsenal of portals, legacy
      systems, and shadow IT the Phone Team needed to access with every customer call.
      Rather, we wanted to provide a single tool that simplified their workflow,
      anticipated their needs, and made it easy and fast to help customers.

    <p>
      Encore Search serves as an elastic search portal for cloud, managed, and hybrid
      customer accounts, which previously were not searchable within the same
      interface. With search suggestions and a multi-paneled interface, users can
      easily find customer information even with scanty search terms and confirm
      they’ve located the correct account. With a unified, global search and a snappy
      API and interface, the Phone Team can help connect customers to account
      specialists more quickly than ever before.
    </p>

    <img src="img/encore_top_results.jpg">

    <p>
      Search suggestions display as the user types in the search box, helping them
      find the correct customer account quickly, regardless of type. 
    </p>

    <img src="img/encore_panels.jpg">

    <p>
      The progressive disclosure of the paneled interface makes it easy for the Phone
      Team to locate related accounts and confirm they’ve found the correct result.
    </p>

    <img src="img/encore_ticket_table.jpg">

    <p>
      An overview of just the right amount of information provides enough context to
      the Phone Team. If more detail is needed, it’s easy to jump to other portals and
      legacy tools to find a specific support ticket or invoice.
    </p>

    <img src="img/encore_search_tips.jpg">

    <p>
      The Phone Team uses Encore Search all day every day to do their jobs. They’re
      tech savvy experts who love shortcuts and expect a high degree of control.
      Encore Search is easy and intuitive to use, but provides shortcuts and jumps in
      workflows for expert users.

    <h2 class="section-title">How We Got There</h2>
    <h3 class="sub-header">Agile methodology & strong communication</h3>
    <p>
      Once we secured buy-in from senior leadership following our kick-off sprint, I
      worked closely with product management and the engineering teams to continue
      collaboration and transparent communication. The API, UI, and design teams
      shared agile sprint cycles with the same product manager. We followed agile
      methodology with short, iterative release cycles, two-week sprints, and regular
      demos to management and the larger team. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We began prototyping in the browser as soon as possible, first with dummy API
      responses until the real thing was available. Tight feedback loops between
      development and design made pivots due to technical hurdles or scope adjustment
      quick and easy.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the sole member of the team with a strong understanding of both the
      development and design disciplines, I translated requests and responses between
      teams. I often interpreted design intent to developers struggling to implement
      interactive features designers hadn’t anticipated, or translated technical
      limitations to designers so they could adjust their mock-ups.
    </p>

    <div class="pull-quote-wide">

    </div>

    <p>
      My involvement aligned development, product, design, and customer on an
      aggressive timeline.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-header">Inspiration</h3>

    <p>
      Few examples of search across such a large, specific data set existed. Though
      commercial sites and search engines offered some ideas, most search interactions
      accommodate users who are browsing and refining rather than trying to locate a
      single, specific result among a mountain of data. Designing Encore Search
      brought the differences in commerical and retail design vs. enterprise design of
      internal tools into stark relief.
    </p>

    <div class="pull-quote-wide">
      <blockquote>
        Most search interactions accommodated users who were browsing and refining
        rather than trying to locate a single, specific result among a mountain of data.
      </blockquote>
    </div>

    <p>
      I knew we needed a powerful yet intuitive search tool. I turned to other
      data-rich search experiences: email clients, chat applications, advanced search
      for libraries and search engines, and filtering and refinement sidebars for
      large retail sites. These search applications served as inspiration for the
      Encore Search interaction and flow, coupled with progressive disclosure and
      Rackspace-specific creative adjustments.
    </p>

    <img src="img/encore_inspiration.jpg">

    <h3 class="sub-header">Whiteboard Sketches & Wireframes</h3>
    <p>
      During the kick-off sprint, I led discussion to nail down the details of what
      information the Phone Team needed to access in order to transfer customers to
      the right people. After speaking with members of the Phone Team to verify our
      assumptions and understand their needs, I led designers and developers to work
      together—what information could the API provide, where should the information be
      displayed, and were certain ideas designers had for interaction possible to
      build on our aggressive timeline?
    </p>

    <p>
      By collaborating closely with the API and UI teams, we were able to vet sketches
      early and understand the limitations of what was achievable on the project’s
      aggressive timeline. White board sketches laid the foundation for what the team
      presented to senior leadership at the end of the week.

    <p>
      Using low-fidelity wireframes and animations in Keynote, we showcased our vision
      for the experience and interaction of Encore Search to senior leadership at the
      end of that first sprint week. Though there were certainly changes and
      refinements, it was easy to see, even at that early stage, the skeleton of the
      final experience we delivered to the Phone Team four months later.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-header">High-fidelity Mock-ups & CSS</h3>
    <p>
      After the kick-off sprint and buy-in from leadership, the team got to work. With
      knowledge of what the UI team needed returned from the API, the API team worked
      to leverage legacy systems and existing API teams to return the data needed more
      quickly than existing tools. With the vision provided by rough wireframes
      produced during the sprint, the UI team began developing the paneled interface
      and animations required that had no precedent in the existing ecosystem of
      internal tools. The design team got to work refining the wireframes with user
      feedback and began to apply color and font choices to create high-fidelity
      mock-ups and specs for the UI team. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Though teams worked concurrently and independently, we shared scrum meetings and
      held regular demos of progress to keep communication clear. During this phase of
      the project, I vetted visual designs and offered critiques. I helped visual
      designers understand what specifications needed to be communicated to
      developers, and which ideas for interaction might increase level of effort or
      affect project scope.
    </p>

    <img src="img/encore_specs.jpg">

    <p>
      The panel interaction, while a creative solution for progressive disclosure and
      way-finding through search results, presented challenges from a user experience
      perspective. We had found a solution that helped the Phone Team zero in on the
      correct search result, but panels had certain ramifications as an interface
      choice. For instance, if a user found a result and opened several subsequent
      panels to see more detail, what should happen when they close the initial result
      panel? Would they expect the subsequent panels to remain open?
    </p>

    <p>
      The design team spent time testing this interaction thoroughly with users to
      gauge their expectations. I facilitated conversations with the UI team to
      understand what options were fastest to implement that would still match user
      expectations. Through negotiation, early prototypes in the browser, and
      productive compromise, we arrived at a solution.
