        Naveon’s Post-Acute Care mobile app

      creates a personalized experience for patients receiving post-acute care.
      We focused on helping patients, patients’ families, and their Care Teams
      get to know each other, engage in important (and sometimes difficult)
      conversations, and stay connected even after discharge.  In addition, we
      designed a web application where Care Teams can manage their patients’
      Plans of Care, define diagnoses, collaborate with other medical staff, and
      customize content offered in the mobile app.

    <h2 class="section-title">The Challenge</h2>
    <h3 class="sub-header">
      Help patients, families, and Care Teams form strong, personal connections
    </h3>
    <p>
      The post-acute care environment can be a challenging one to navigate for
      patients, families, and Care Teams.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Care Teams, communicating conditions clearly and recommending
      treatments is already difficult, and in palliative care—where the goal is
      to comfort the patient rather than provide curative or preventative
      treatment—this is even more challenging.
    </p>

    <p>
      For patients and families, understanding the significance of a decision
      can be murky. They often lack the context to see ripple effects, or they get
      lost in endless medical jargon. For loved ones making decisions on an
      incapacitated patient’s behalf, it can be a struggle to weigh the
      patient’s desires against their own.
    </p>

    <p>
      Naveon, a leading healthcare technology company, wanted to incorporate lessons
      learned from their intensive care unit apps and brainstorm new ways of
      enhancing doctor/patient communication.
    </p>

    <p>
      They understood the medical, emotional, and spiritual crises that can
      occur when someone is seriously ill, and that the best decisions are made
      when patients, families, and Care Teams forge meaningful, personal
      connections to each other. Research shows that improved communication
      leads to a reduction in unwanted care and higher satisfaction for
      patients.
    </p>

    <p>
      They needed an app to:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Accelerate the process of Care Teams getting to know their patients’
          personalities, core values, beliefs, and care preferences
        </li>

        <li>
          Facilitate difficult conversations between patients and their families
        </li>

        <li>
          Help families and loved ones make decisions even if a patient is incapacitated
        </li>

        <li>
          Keep patients connected to their Care Teams even after discharge (and
          prevent unnecessary visits to the emergency room)
        </li>

        <li>
          Customize content based on a patient’s diagnosis, care facility, or health situation
        </li>

        <li>
          Assist Care Teams efficiently manage a wide range of patients
        </li>

    <h2 class="section-title">My Role</h2>
    <h3 class="sub-header">
      Simplify complex cross-platform systems to create an engaging, personal experience
    </h3>
    <p>
      As the sole designer on such a large cross-platform project, I led the design
      process from start to finish on NewAperio’s small, highly-collaborative,
      cross-disciplinary team and worked directly with their customer, Naveon.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before engaging us, Naveon had already launched a similar mobile and web
      application to manage content for patients in intensive care units. Naveon
      wanted to incorporate lessons learned in the ICU and brainstorm new ways
      of enhancing doctor/patient communication in the new post-acute context.
    </p>

    <p>
      Though Naveon’s team had already developed content and knew the key to
      success laid in building close connections between Care Teams and their
      patients, they weren’t entirely sure where to make changes or how to
      improve their current model.
    </p>

    <p>
      My work with the Naveon team revealed that while the content they created
      supported and educated patients, it fell short in creating a system Care
      Teams could use to “treat the whole person.” We needed to design an
      engaging experience and prompt patients, families, and Care Teams to
      consider how a patient’s values, beliefs, and preferences can inform
      decision making about healthcare.

  <div class="column-1">
    <h3 class="sub-header large">Product Design Sprint</h3>
    <p>
      With NewAperio’s Founder & CEO, I led a Product Design Sprint—a five-phase
      process (modeled after
      <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/">the process defined by Google Ventures</a>)
      that uses design thinking to brainstorm and prototype innovative solutions
      and test them with real customers.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-header large">Planning & Scope Definition</h3>
    <p>
      I partnered with my client (<a href="http://www.newaperio.com">NewAperio</a>)
      and their customer (<a href="http://www.naveonguides.com">Naveon</a>) to uncover
      assumptions, identify complexities, gather and clarify requirements, and write user
      stories. I worked closely with developers to vet technical feasibility and
      create a shared understanding of the problems we needed to solve.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="column-2">
    <h3 class="sub-header large">Strategy & Vision</h3>
    <p>
      Following a heuristic evaluation, I created the concept of “Get To Know
      Me”, which became the central feature of the application. I devised
      information architecture for the complex administrative back end used by
      Care Teams to manage content, as well as the intuitive user-facing mobile
      application.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-header large">Illustration & Visual Design</h3>
    <p>
      I shifted Naveon’s color palette to increase accessibility while
      maintaining the established brand. I created a visual vocabulary and design
      system for use across platforms with visual flourishes and custom
      illustrations that reinforce Naveon’s brand messaging around guidance and
      support.

    <h2 class="section-title">The Approach</h2>
    <h3 class="sub-header">Early prototyping and user testing with a product
      design sprint</h3>
    <p>
      Following the framework outlined by Google Ventures’
      <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/">
        <em>Sprint: Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days</em>
      </a>,
      we mapped the problem, sketched detailed solutions, identified
      our primary goal, created a prototype, then interviewed and tested with users in
      just five days.
    </p>

    <div class="pull-quote-wide">
      <blockquote>
        The design sprint process...was among the best I have encountered in my
        35+ year career. The well-defined structure imposed a
        discipline on the process that amplified both the productivity and
        creativity, where frequently the focus on one occurs at the expense of
        the other. The testing of our design output that followed yielded real
        insight and we walked away from the process with solid concepts and a
        framework for moving forward. It also made it even clearer that this was
        a team of individuals with whom we wanted to work.
      </blockquote>
      <div class="endorsement-author">–Kevin Lyle, Founder & CTO @ Naveon</div>
    </div>

    <p> </p>

    <p>
      For the design sprint, we focused on creating higher engagement and
      satisfaction for patients and their families (even after discharge), while
      making it easier for Care Teams to deliver high-quality care.
    </p>

    <img src="img/naveon_sketch.jpg">

    <p>
      In early sketches, I conceptualized how we might gather information like
      values, beliefs, hobbies, and other personal characteristics about the
      Patient. The experience should draw the user in with highly interactive
      inputs and flows centered around sharing and exploring. Still, we needed
      to gently guide patients and their loved ones to help them zero in on when
      and how to make decisions about their care, supported by educational
      resources and a close relationship to their Care Team.
    </p>

    <img src="img/naveon_prototype.jpg">

    <p>
      For the prototype we tested, we included a “nucleus”-like design
      that allowed users to define what was important to them, assign
      it an emoji, and put things more dear to them closer to the center of the
      circle design. In our user testing sessions, we found that while the
      concept of a personal profile as a way to connect with Care Teams
      resonated deeply, the idea and design of the “nucleus” interface
      wasn’t intuitive enough.

    <h2 class="section-title">Designing the "Get To Know Me" Experience</h2>
    <h3 class="sub-header">A dynamic, flexible system for Care Teams & an
      engaging profile builder for patients</h3>

    <p>
      With valuable feedback gathered from users during the design sprint, we
      knew we needed to pivot and expand our approach for onboarding patients
      with a rich questionnaire and profile builder in the mobile app.
    </p>

    <p>
      We needed a way to solicit specific personal information from patients and
      their families without making them feel they were filling out long, dense
      health forms at the doctor’s office. How could we ask them questions that
      prompted personal reflection and felt engaging and fun? How might the
      mobile app kick-start a warm experience getting to know their Care Team?
    </p>

    <p>
      I looked to dating apps for inspiration, as they often have long
      onboarding processes or profile builders with dozens of personal
      questions, yet feel fun and engaging rather than something arduous to
      skip over. Users feel engaged, open up about themselves, and can revisit or
      tweak their profile over time.
    </p>

    <img src="img/naveon_heuristic.jpg">

    <p>
      With a heuristic evaluation of half a dozen dating apps in hand, I shared
      the inspiration with Naveon, and they loved the idea.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our team faced the challenge of creating a system that allowed Care Teams
      to specify custom "Get To Know Me" questions and flows depending on a
      patient’s diagnosis, all editable as part of a content management system
      accessible on the web.
    </p>

    <p>
      Together with Naveon we defined a limited number of question types to keep
      scope manageable for development and ensure that questions could be
      created and customized in the content management system.
    </p>

    <img src="img/naveon_gtkm.png">

    <h3 class="sub-header">
      A broad, flexible style for custom illustration to communicate brand
    </h3>

    <p>
      With question types defined and interactive screens designed, I proposed
      developing a unique and flexible illustration style that can evolve as
      Naveon grows—something visually appealing that works in many contexts and
      across character, scene, spot, and icon illustrations.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was tasked with creating a collection of vibrant, whimsical, informal
      illustrations that could be used to break up sections of questions.
      Because "Get To Know Me" questions may vary by a patient’s diagnosis or
      care facility, I could not anticipate what content or question an
      illustration might be paired with.
    </p>

    <img src="img/naveon_illustration1.png">

    <p>
      To create a broad and flexible system, I identified unified concepts,
      themes, motifs, and visual styles that communicate Naveon’s brand while
      taking into account the user’s emotional state. I wanted illustrations and
      visual style—like the app itself—to guide and support the patient’s
      experience. I focused on illustrations that depict journeys, guidance, and
      peaceful or expansive landscapes.
    </p>

    <img src="img/naveon_illustration2.jpg">

    <p>
      Some of the emotional themes I identified were in direct contrast to
      situations the patient or their families find themselves in—a contrast to
      emotions we typically associate with post-acute care. Visuals and
      interactive design in the app seek to soothe and support, rather than
      amplify the stress and confusion that can often accompany medical events.
    </p>

    <img src="img/naveon_illustration3.png">

    <p>
      At the same time, it was important that illustrations and visuals
      strive for balance. Scenes, characters, and themes depicted shouldn’t feel
      insensitive, oblivious, or out of touch with the user’s situation. When
      using the app, users should feel:

      <ul>
        <li>
          Supported, NOT isolated
        </li>

        <li>
          Excited to learn and explore, NOT bewildered or illiterate in the face
          of medical events
        </li>

        <li>
          Informed and confident in decisions, NOT uncertain and hopeless
        </li>

        <li>
          Comforted, NOT in pain
        </li>

        <li>
          Calm and at peace, NOT stressed and confused
        </li>

        <li>
          Intent, deliberate, and confident in decisions, NOT reactive
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

<section>
  <div class="case-study">
    <h2 class="section-title">Cross-Platform, Cohesive Design</h2>
    <h3 class="sub-header">Collaborating with developers</h3>
    <p>
      To power the mobile application, Care Teams needed a robust content
      management system where they could manage staff, assign patients to Care
      Team members, create Plans of Care, monitor any calls or requests from
      patients, edit settings on a specific facility, define diagnoses, and
      customize what content a patient sees in their mobile app’s Content
      Library.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even with the complex needs for this administrative back end and multiple
      user roles, Naveon wanted an intuitive experience and an easy-to-use
      interface that wouldn’t get in the way of providing patients with
      high-quality care.
    </p>

    <p>
      The application had to work across multiple device sizes for Care Team
      members. Care Team members might work across multiple care facilities with
      potentially hundreds of patients. I worked to define an information
      hierarchy and navigational structure to reflect complex relationships
      while making them easy to understand and navigate. I provided robust
      documentation around interactive states, user roles, and screen size for
      developers working on the project.
    </p>

    <img src="img/naveon_nav.jpg">

    <p>
      I provided a number of other resources to aid developers like extended,
      accessible color palettes that provide adequate contrast, even for low
      vision users.
    </p>

    <img src="img/naveon_colors.jpg">

    <p>
      I also used construction of the style guide to vet components for use
      across platforms: on the darker gradient backgrounds of onboarding and
      "Get To Know Me" screens in the mobile app or on light backgrounds in the
      web application. By vetting design of components early,
      I ensured the mobile and web applications could share visual vocabulary
      despite these differences.
    </p>

    <img src="img/naveon_dci.jpg">

    <p>
      Care Team members needed a high density of data to accomplish their tasks
      in the web application, but I didn’t want them to feel overwhelmed. I kept
      visual elements minimal to make it easy to focus on content and tasks. The
      end result: the interface feels on-brand and in relationship with the
      mobile application, but the design doesn’t get in the user’s way.
    </p>

    <img src="img/naveon_poc.jpg">

    <p>
      Where possible, long tasks and user flows were broken down into multi-step
      wizards so Care Team members could focus on the discrete task at hand or
      return to it at a later time.
    </p>

    <img src="img/naveon_library.jpg">

    <p>
      Highly interactive interface designs incorporate drag and drop to
      navigate complex content hierarchies or file trees so the user can control
      how much data they see without missing any details.
