		<h2 class="section-title">The Challenge</h2>
		<h3 class="sub-header">Improve search to assist customers more quickly</h3>
		<p>
			Rackspace, the largest managed cloud provider, counts fanatical support as its
			leading differentiator. Customers can call in 24/7/365 and expect to reach
			someone—no pressing zero for an agent, no decision trees. The Phone Team’s
			methodology for routing customer calls required weeks of training, antiquated
			manual systems, and a lot of tribal knowledge.
		</p>

		<p>
			With different portals for different account types, the Phone Team searched
			several legacy systems to locate a customer’s account information just to
			identify which specialist to connect with the customer.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Phone Team’s original request: to improve integration of Rackspace’s phone
			system with multiple customer relationship management systems. “Oh,” they said,
			“we also need improved search capabilities so that we assist customers more
			quickly.”
		</p>

		<p>
			It’s often the “Oh, and…” requests from clients that expose the real problems
			that need to be addressed. It takes careful listening to hear beyond the
			client’s proposed solutions and uncover the real problem at hand.  
		</p>

    <p>
      The challenge:
      <ul>
				<li>
					Help members of the Phone Team find accounts, verify customers, and transfer
					calls to the right person at Rackspace who could help them
        </li>
				<li>
					Reduce the number of legacy applications, interfaces, and systems the Phone Team
					must access to locate a customer account
        </li>
				<li>
					Leverage legacy APIs, LDAP groups, and other existing systems, but provide a
					better, faster search experience
        </li>
				<li>
					Reduce the amount of training needed to onboard new Phone Team members by
					providing a simplified, more intuitive work flow
        </li>
				<li>
					Reduce customer call time by enabling the Phone Team to more quickly connect
					customers to the right person the first time

		<h2 class="section-title">My Role</h2>
		<h3 class="sub-header">The grey area between development & design?</h3>
    <p>
			Following an expansive research effort to illuminate pain points and areas of
			inefficiency on Rackspace’s support floor, The Encore Search project brought
			several high-performing teams together. Few team members had engaged in
			cross-disciplinary work to the extent that the Encore Search project demanded or
			worked on a team so big.
		</p>

		<p>
			At such a large company, designers and developers had grown accustomed to
			working in silos to make incremental improvements to legacy applications. Few
			were prepared to collaborate with coworkers who didn’t share their expertise and
			were unaccustomed to the level of interdisciplinary collaboration the project
			demanded. As someone with both a design and development background, I worked to
			“grease the wheels” between software developers and designers.
    </p>

		<h3 class="sub-header large">User Research & Insights</h3>
		<p>
			In the months leading up to the project, I participated in multiple research
			sessions led by Rackspace’s UX Research Team. Using the framework and rubric
			they defined, I conducted extensive interviews with Rackers across the Support
			Floor.  I presented findings to the development team to provide them valuable
			context they needed for collaboration during the sprint.
		</p>

		<h3 class="sub-header large">Planning & Scope Definition</h3>
		<p>
			I uncovered assumptions during the initial sprint and worked with the customer
			and the UI, API, and design teams to gather requirements. I communicated across
			teams to understand the underlying systems, vet technical feasibility, and
			create a shared understanding of the problems we needed to solve to deliver a
			useful tool to the customer in the time available.

	<div class="column-2">
		<h3 class="sub-header large">Design Execution & Code Review</h3>
		<p>
			I wrote LESS and HTML to implement designs created by the visual design team,
			and collaborated to adjust font sizes, color, animations, etc. in the browser to
			match their intent. I reviewed front-end code written by other software
			developers to ensure consistency. In cases where visual designers had overlooked
			interactive states (loading, error, hover, etc.), I defined what was needed and
			served as facilitator between the development and design teams.
		</p>

		<h3 class="sub-header large">Leadership</h3>
		<p>
			I facilitated discussion and led collaboration between product management and
			the UI, API, and design teams during the initial sprint and throughout the life

  <div class="case-study">
		<h2 class="section-title">The Approach</h2>
		<h3 class="sub-header">A cross-disciplinary kick-off sprint</h3>
    <p>
			Despite leveraging legacy systems, we’d be starting from scratch to imagine a
			new tool. Our customer, the Phone Team, had never used software custom-built for
			their workflow, and instead were forced to use existing ineffecient tools and
			manual workflows to accomplish tasks. 
    </p>

    <p>
			Particularly stunning was Research’s finding that the Phone Team relied on
			monthly email distribution of a 20-slide deck detailing names and phone numbers
			of key people and departments within the company where they may need to route
			customer calls. Often the slide deck was printed so Rackers could shuffle
			through the pages at their desks while on a call. All this to connect a call
			after they had searched up to four legacy systems to locate the customer’s
			account. 
    </p>

    <p>
			We had a hard deadline that required us to deliver something to the customer
			before the end of the year, giving us roughly four months from kick-off to
			release, with a few weeks at the tail end for user acceptance testing and bug
			squashing before closing out business for the year.
    </p>

    <p>
			Armed with research findings and the Phone Team’s request to focus on improving
			search, the team assembled to kick off the project with a five-day sprint. We
			arrived on Monday morning and the project began with no design, no interface, no
			back end, no UI, no API, very few requirements, and only a high-level request
			from the customer.
    </p>

    <p>
			Following the framework outlined in Jake Knapp’s book <em>Sprint: Solve Big Problems
			and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days</em>, we mapped the problem, sketched detailed
			solutions, vetted technical feasibility, created prototypes, and demonstrated
			our work to senior leadership in just five days.

		<h2 class="section-title">Discovery</h2>
		<h3 class="sub-header">Tight feedback loops across disciplines</h3>
    <p>
			With all hands on deck for the sprint, we found ourselves all in one room
			surrounded by whiteboards, ready to work but not quite sure where to begin.
			Product management, API developers, UI developers, interns, designers—we had all
			assembled to solve the Phone Team’s search problem, but initially struggled in
			fits and starts to focus with so many disciplines present. As the only team
			member with both design and development expertise, I led the effort to uncover
			requirements for the project and kickstarted collaboration.
    </p>

    <p>
			After introductions and some false starts, I walked to the white board with a
			marker in hand and drew a high-level user journey to illustrate the steps the
			Phone Team might take in their work flow if we provided them with a
			search-centric application. The flow, with revisions and contributions from the
			team, became a touchstone we returned to throughout the project.
    </p>

    <img src="img/encore_user_flow.png">

    <p>
			Throughout the one-week sprint, we found a natural cadence of splitting to work
			as independent disciplines (design, UI, API dev, etc.) and coming back together
			to make sure we were still in sync. In this way, we quickly made major decisions
			about the structure of the API, the look and feel of the interface, and the
			search algorithm while maintaining unity of vision and shared momentum. Tight
			feedback loops and collaboration across disciplines made Encore Search a strong
			tool from the very beginning.

    <p>
			Throughout the sprint, the leader and key members of the Phone Team would
			join us for half an hour to answer questions about their workflow, validate
			sketches and design ideas, and verify assumptions the team made about their
			needs. We also referred back to the study completed earlier in the year and the
			findings associated with the Phone Team.

		<h2 class="section-title">Introducing Encore Search</h2>
		<h3 class="sub-header">Smart, fast search for expert users</h3>
    <p>
			The vision for Encore Search: to help the Phone Team find accounts, verify
			customers, and transfer calls to the right specialist who could help them with
			whatever they were calling about. 
    </p>

    <p>
			We didn’t want to provide yet another tool in the arsenal of portals, legacy
			systems, and shadow IT the Phone Team needed to access with every customer call.
			Rather, we wanted to provide a single tool that simplified their workflow,
			anticipated their needs, and made it easy and fast to help customers.
    </p>

		</div>

    <p>
			Encore Search serves as an elastic search portal for cloud, managed, and hybrid
			customer accounts, which previously were not searchable within the same
			interface. With search suggestions and a multi-paneled interface, users can
			easily find customer information even with scanty search terms and confirm
			they’ve located the correct account. With a unified, global search and a snappy
			API and interface, the Phone Team can help connect customers to account
			specialists more quickly than ever before.
		</p>

    <img src="img/encore_top_results.jpg">

    <p>
			Search suggestions display as the user types in the search box, helping them
			find the correct customer account quickly, regardless of type. 
    </p>

    <img src="img/encore_panels.jpg">

    <p>
			The progressive disclosure of the paneled interface makes it easy for the Phone
			Team to locate related accounts and confirm they’ve found the correct result.
    </p>

    <img src="img/encore_ticket_table.jpg">

    <p>
			An overview of just the right amount of information provides enough context to
			the Phone Team. If more detail is needed, it’s easy to jump to other portals and
			legacy tools to find a specific support ticket or invoice.
    </p>

    <img src="img/encore_search_tips.jpg">

    <p>
			The Phone Team uses Encore Search all day every day to do their jobs. They’re
			tech savvy experts who love shortcuts and expect a high degree of control.
			Encore Search is easy and intuitive to use, but provides shortcuts and jumps in
			workflows for expert users.

  <div class="case-study">
		<h2 class="section-title">How We Got There</h2>
		<h3 class="sub-header">Agile methodology & strong communication</h3>
    <p>
			Once we secured buy-in from senior leadership following our kick-off sprint, I
			worked closely with product management and the engineering teams to continue
			collaboration and transparent communication. The API, UI, and design teams
			shared agile sprint cycles with the same product manager. We followed agile
			methodology with short, iterative release cycles, two-week sprints, and regular
			demos to management and the larger team. 
    </p>

    <p>
			We began prototyping in the browser as soon as possible, first with dummy API
			responses until the real thing was available. Tight feedback loops between
			development and design made pivots due to technical hurdles or scope adjustment
			quick and easy.
    </p>

    <p>
			As the sole member of the team with a strong understanding of both the
			development and design disciplines, I translated requests and responses between
			teams. I often interpreted design intent to developers struggling to implement
			interactive features designers hadn’t anticipated, or translated technical
			limitations to designers so they could adjust their mock-ups.
    </p>

		<div class="pull-quote-wide">

			</blockquote>
		</div>

    <p>
			My involvement aligned development, product, design, and customer on an
			aggressive timeline.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-header">Inspiration</h3>

    <p>
			Few examples of search across such a large, specific data set existed. Though
			commercial sites and search engines offered some ideas, most search interactions
			accommodate users who are browsing and refining rather than trying to locate a
			single, specific result among a mountain of data. Designing Encore Search
			brought the differences in commerical and retail design vs. enterprise design of
			internal tools into stark relief.
    </p>

		<div class="pull-quote-wide">
			<blockquote>
				Most search interactions accommodated users who were browsing and refining
				rather than trying to locate a single, specific result among a mountain of data.
			</blockquote>
		</div>

    <p>
			I knew we needed a powerful yet intuitive search tool. I turned to other
			data-rich search experiences: email clients, chat applications, advanced search
			for libraries and search engines, and filtering and refinement sidebars for
			large retail sites. These search applications served as inspiration for the
			Encore Search interaction and flow, coupled with progressive disclosure and
			Rackspace-specific creative adjustments.
    </p>

    <img src="img/encore_inspiration.jpg">

    <h3 class="sub-header">Whiteboard Sketches & Wireframes</h3>
    <p>
			During the kick-off sprint, I led discussion to nail down the details of what
			information the Phone Team needed to access in order to transfer customers to
			the right people. After speaking with members of the Phone Team to verify our
			assumptions and understand their needs, I led designers and developers to work
			together—what information could the API provide, where should the information be
			displayed, and were certain ideas designers had for interaction possible to
			build on our aggressive timeline?
    </p>

    <p>
			By collaborating closely with the API and UI teams, we were able to vet sketches
			early and understand the limitations of what was achievable on the project’s
			aggressive timeline. White board sketches laid the foundation for what the team
			presented to senior leadership at the end of the week.
    </p>

			</blockquote>
		</div>

    <img src="img/encore_prototype.gif">

    <p>
			Using low-fidelity wireframes and animations in Keynote, we showcased our vision
			for the experience and interaction of Encore Search to senior leadership at the
			end of that first sprint week. Though there were certainly changes and
			refinements, it was easy to see, even at that early stage, the skeleton of the
			final experience we delivered to the Phone Team four months later.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-header">High-fidelity Mock-ups & CSS</h3>
    <p>
			After the kick-off sprint and buy-in from leadership, the team got to work. With
			knowledge of what the UI team needed returned from the API, the API team worked
			to leverage legacy systems and existing API teams to return the data needed more
			quickly than existing tools. With the vision provided by rough wireframes
			produced during the sprint, the UI team began developing the paneled interface
			and animations required that had no precedent in the existing ecosystem of
			internal tools. The design team got to work refining the wireframes with user
			feedback and began to apply color and font choices to create high-fidelity
			mock-ups and specs for the UI team. 
    </p>

    <p>
			Though teams worked concurrently and independently, we shared scrum meetings and
			held regular demos of progress to keep communication clear. During this phase of
			the project, I vetted visual designs and offered critiques. I helped visual
			designers understand what specifications needed to be communicated to
			developers, and which ideas for interaction might increase level of effort or
			affect project scope.
    </p>

    <img src="img/encore_specs.jpg">

    <p>
			The panel interaction, while a creative solution for progressive disclosure and
			way-finding through search results, presented challenges from a user experience
			perspective. We had found a solution that helped the Phone Team zero in on the
			correct search result, but panels had certain ramifications as an interface
			choice. For instance, if a user found a result and opened several subsequent
			panels to see more detail, what should happen when they close the initial result
			panel? Would they expect the subsequent panels to remain open?
    </p>

    <p>
			The design team spent time testing this interaction thoroughly with users to
			gauge their expectations. I facilitated conversations with the UI team to
			understand what options were fastest to implement that would still match user
			expectations. Through negotiation, early prototypes in the browser, and
			productive compromise, we arrived at a solution.

		<h3 class="sub-header">Final Design</h3>
    <p>
			Encore Search shipped on time. The Phone Team was delighted with the experience,
			which gave them a single tool to replace multiple legacy systems. The user flow
			of locating customer data to route a call was reduced from four tools and 16
			screens to one tool and one screen. Call time was decreased by 75%, saving the
			company $220k per year and saving customers 3,507 hours. With the time saved,
			the Phone Team was able to accept more calls than ever before.

    <h3 class="sub-header">Awards & Recognition</h3>
    <p>
			Following launch, word spread quickly about a fast new search tool, and within
			weeks Rackers across the support floor—not just the Phone Team—began using
			Encore Search as part of their daily work flow. Its successful release kicked
			off plans to retire legacy systems and phase out clunky, expensive interfaces.
    </p>

    <p>
			The highest levels of senior leadership recognized Encore Search as a tremendous
			success. The designers and developers on the project received a Rackem Award for
			Service Delivery Innovation from the senior leadership team for work on a
			critical and high-impact project.
    </p>

    <p>
			Josh Schairbaum, a Director of Software Development in Racker Tools who worked
			with the team, wrote, “We’ve taken a significant problem leading to poor
			customer experience inside Rackspace and used our particular set of skills to
			provide a solution that is performant, maintainable, and extensible. It’s going
			to be the foundation for many of the things we do in the coming months and will
			be a day-to-day fixture for almost every Racker.”

		</div>
		<p>
			To share our success and highlight the processes and ways of working, I gave a
			talk at RAX.io, Rackspace’s internal conference. Though the majority of
			attendees and talks have a development focus, our talk “The Secret Sauce:
			Bridging the Gap Between Development and Design,” focused on design processes
			and cross-team collaboration. With Eric Weidner, Encore Search’s visual
			designer, I shared how we worked from the outside in, what processes we used,
			and how others could use the same approach on their teams.

    <h3 class="sub-header">The Foundation for a New Platform</h3>
    <p>
			As Schairbaum hinted following release, Encore Search went on to become a
			powerful tool used daily on the support floor, and inspired subsequent projects
			to tailor the experience for  users beyond the Phone Team. The Encore Search
			interface became the foundation for several other tools, including Dispatch, a
			tool for logging interactions with customers outside of support tickets, and
			Origin, an extendable application frame and platform to unite legacy tools in a
			single interface until they could be redesigned or retired.
